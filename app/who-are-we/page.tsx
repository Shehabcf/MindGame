                GamerMind was born from personal experience. Our founders weren't just developers or therapistsâ€”they
                were gamers who had walked the difficult path of mental health struggles within gaming culture. They
                understood the unique challenges that traditional mental health services couldn't address.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 2023, after years of research and community feedback, we launched GamerMind as more than just another
                mental health app. We created a platform that speaks the language of gaming, understands the culture,
                and provides support that actually resonates with our community.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we're a diverse team of gamers, mental health professionals, developers, and community builders,
                all united by a single mission: making mental health support accessible, relatable, and effective for
                gaming communities worldwide.
